# ENVIR_ST_956_FinalProject_ChangeDetection
A final project for UW-Madison's ENVIR ST 956: Advanced Remote Sensing

This notebook uses multiple change detection methods to examine the landscape change caused by a windstorm that occured in Lewis and Clark National Historical Park in December of 2007. Two Landsat 5 SR images, one from July of 2007 and the other from 2008, are used to detect the change. Both images have 30 m resolution, and contain six bands - blue, green, red, NIR, SWIR1, and SWIR2.

The change detection methods use are: image differencing, image ratio, and change vector analysis.

Images were acquired using Google Earth Engine.
